## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This MATLAB project models and optimizes a counterflow heat exchanger using the NTU-effectiveness method. The goal is to minimize annual operating costs under a 5 kPa pressure drop constraint using dynamic flow control and cost-aware design.

### Key Highlights
- 40% average cost reduction during peak hours  
- 70% savings during off-peak operation  
- <0.1% error against theoretical benchmarks  
- Full NTU validation and sensitivity analysis

## How to Run

1. **Clone this repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/heat-exchanger-optimization.git
```

2. **Open in MATLAB**, navigate to the `Code/` folder and run:
```matlab
runALL
```

This will:
- Run baseline and optimization simulations
- Generate and save all output plots in `/Plots`
- Display cost and effectiveness metrics in the console
